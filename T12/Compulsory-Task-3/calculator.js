// T12 - Compulsory-Task-3

/* You are going to create a calculator that
can do a calculation on any two numbers you give it.

You will need to create four functions:
- add - This function will add the two numbers
together.
- subtract - This function will subtract the 
second number from the first number.
- multiply - This function will multiply the
two numbers together.
- divide - This function will divide the first
number by the second number.

- Your calculator should ask the user to 
input the first number, the second number 
and what operation they would like to perform 
on those numbers.

- The program should then log the calculation
and the total to the console.
e.g. if the user inputs 6, 7 and multiply,
the output would be 6 x 7 = 42.
