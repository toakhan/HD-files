          <h2>1960 Presidential Campaign: Kennedy vs. Nixon</h2>
          <p>In 1960, Kennedy announced his candidacy for President of the United States, running against Republican Vice President Richard Nixon. The campaign was closely contested, with both candidates engaging in a series of televised debates that were watched by millions of Americans.</p>

          <h2>The Kennedy Administration: Domestic and Foreign Policy</h2>
          <p>As President, Kennedy presided over a period of significant social and political change in the United States. He advocated for civil rights and economic growth, and launched several major initiatives, including the Peace Corps, the Alliance for Progress, and the space program.</p>

          <h2>Space Exploration: "We Choose to Go to the Moon</h2>
          <p>One of Kennedy's signature accomplishments as President was his commitment to space exploration. In 1961, he announced a goal of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to Earth by the end of the decade.</p>
          <p>This ambitious goal was realized in 1969, when astronauts Neil Armstrong and Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin became the first humans to walk on the moon.</p>

          <h2>Civil Rights: "The Question of Equality"</h2>
          <p>Kennedy was a vocal advocate for civil rights, but progress on this front was slow during his presidency. He faced significant resistance from Southern Democrats who opposed integration and equal rights for African Americans.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, Kennedy took several steps to address the issue, including sending federal troops to enforce desegregation in Alabama and delivering a landmark speech in 1963 in which he called for a comprehensive civil rights bill.</p>

          <p>After several tense days of negotiation, the Soviet Union agreed to remove the missiles, and the crisis was averted.</p>
