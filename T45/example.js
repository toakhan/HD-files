// PLEASE ENSURE YOU OPEN THIS FILE IN IDLE otherwise you will not be able to read it.

// *** NOTE ON COMMENTS ***
// This is a comment in Javascript. 
// Comments can be placed anywhere in Javascript code and the computer ignores them -- they are intended to be read by humans. 
// Any line with a // in front of it is a comment.
// Please read all the comments in this example file and all others.


// ========= Reading Javascript code ========= 
// You're actually reading a Javascript program right now.
// Comments in Javascript appear in GREEN if you have the file opened in Notepad++ and RED if you have it opened in IDLE.
// Keywords of the Javascript language appear in BLUE in Notepad++ and PURPLE in IDLE. 
// Most other programming languages have the same structure as Javascript, so if you learn Javascript, you can learn the others more easily! It's not like learning human languages.


//  =========  The console.log() function ========= 
// You may want your program to display or output information to the user.
// The most common way to view program output is to use the print function.
// To use print, we enter the print command followed by one or more arguments. 

// ************ Example 1 ************
console.log("Hello, World!")
// When you run this program the computer will output the argument Hello, World!
// Note that the argument is enclosed in double quotes ("..."), which are not displayed in the output.
// This is because "Hello, World!" is a string or list of characters.

// ************ Example 2 ************
console.log("Printing a string.") 

// A common SYNTAX error you could make above is by forgetting to add a closing ".
// Remember that all opening quotation marks (") require a closing one!


// ************ Example 3 ************

let name = "HyperionDev"
let age = 10

// The variable 'name' stores "Hello" into the box as a string.
// The variable 'age' also stores 10 into the box as a numerical value.
// Now, when you try running this file, notice the output produced by the following command.
console.log(name, age)

// A common SYNTAX error you could make above is by forgetting to add a closing ‘)’.
// Remember that all opening brackets ‘(’ , require a matching closing one!


//  ========= Running Javascript files ========= 
// Now that you know how to write code, it's time to learn how to execute your code to see what the output is.
// Let's 'RUN' this Javascript file and take a look at what output it produces (if any).
// When you write Javascript code, you'll have to run it often to test that your programs are doing what you'd like them to do.

// There are different ways to 'run' Javascript files.

//  ========= OPTION 1: Run from IDLE Javascript GUI -- THE EASY WAY ========= 
// The easiest way to run Javascript files and this program is through a GUI (Graphical User Interface). 
// Press F5 on your keyboard to RUN the Javascript file and the output will appear in a separate Javascript output (Javascript Shell) window!
// You can use this method to run ANY Javascript file (file with a .js extension). 
// If there is an error in your code, the code won't run and the error will be printed out in the Javascript Shell window.

// Errors are things like trying to add two variables that aren't the same data type, or using a variable that isn't declared! 
// (i.e. if you say num = num1+num2 and you haven't said what num1 and num2 are above this statement!)
// We'll talk about errors more later.

// Play around with this program. Change statements and delete things, run the code and see what happens.

// We advise that you complete all tasks and open all example files in IDLE from now on.
// Perhaps create a shortcut to IDLE on your desktop so that you can access it faster.
// You can also use Notepad++ to view the example.js files, but Notepad++ can only be used to view the text of a code. You can't run programs from within Notepad++.


//  ========= OPTION 2: Use any GUI/IDE that you want.  -- ADVANCED ========= 
// An IDE is a program like the IDLE Javascript GUI.
// You get many programs that let you run code within them.
// Some of these IDEs are more complicated than others.
// As long as you know how to use IDLE, you can complete our entire course.
