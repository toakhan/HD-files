/* To run this code:
1. Copy 'Example 2' folder to your local machine.
2. Navigate to this folder.
4. You should now be able to execute this by opening it in a Chromium-based browser, pressing F12 and navigating to the
console.

In this example we use the Fetch API to fetch data about a book that is made available usign the Google Books API:
 https://developers.google.com/books/docs/static-links
To see what is returned when we call the fetch() function, copy and paste the URL that is passed as an argument to the 
fetch function into your browser.
*/

// Create an array called 'items' - we will store the data that we retrieve using the fetch API in this variable.
let items = []; 

/* 
  We use the fetch function below to fetch data using the argument specified (which is in this case is the URL 
  for the Google Books API which will return json about books). Remember that the fetch function returns a promise 
  that resolves to the Response to that request, whether it is successful or not.  Remember that a promise basically
  allows the interpreter to carry on with other tasks while a function is executed without waiting for that function to 
  finish. This is because the promise, ‘promises’ to let you know the outcome of the function once it is finished. The 
  basic structure of a promise is: doSomething().then(successCallback, failureCallback);
  A promise uses callbacks to execute different functions based on whether the desired action succeeded or failed.

      // instead of a catch() block so that we don't swallow
      // exceptions from actual bugs in our web application.

/* Step 3: Copy and paste the URL for the API (https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=isbn:0747532699) into your browser
to examine the data returned by google books. Now write the code to display only the title and description of the book returned.*/
